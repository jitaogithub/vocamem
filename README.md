# Vocamem
A boon for vocabulary memorizing
## Introduction
Vocamem is a tool for customized experience of effective vocabulary memorizing. Inspired by existing apps, Vocamem make words repeatedly occur until they are believed to have been memorized. Users may also personalize the learning scheme by editing the records so that they can walk at their own pace.
## Ready-to-go binary files
Several versions of executives for different operating systems are already built for instant use in `/bin/`. Please choose accordingly. For Windows users, please choose `vocamem-x86.exe` if you don't know what x64 means to you.
## Building
Vocamem is written in C++14 using STL. Any compiler supporting C++14 should work.
## Sample
The sample is the 3000 GRE vocabulary summarized by Jason Chen and Vocamem claims no copyright of it. To fit different operating systems, the sample is in two versions. The GBK version is specially for Windows in Chinese. Please use the UTF-8 version on other systems.
